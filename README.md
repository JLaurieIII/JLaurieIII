Hi my name is James Laurie.

I have been spending nearly all of my waking hours to learn how to program in Java.

I am currently employed by a company called GenSpark that is utulizing me with all the tools to be a successful programmer.

Constructive criticism is always welcome and more importantly highly appreciative.
